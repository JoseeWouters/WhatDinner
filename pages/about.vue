            <h2>Once upon a time...</h2>
            <p>There were two developers sitting at the dinner table and looking at each other: "What should we have for dinner?"</p>
            <p>"I don't know," said the first one after a while.</p>
            <p>"Maybe we should put a pizza in the oven," the other said hesistantly.</p>
            <p>And they did. While they were waiting for the pizza to be ready, the first developer said: "We should develop an app for this! Let it choose what we should eat."</p>
            <h2>So I did</h2>
            <p>I'm Josee Wouters and I developed What Dinner? to help me decide what I should eat.</p>
            <p>Now you can download and try What Dinner too. Hopefully it will make your life, or at least your dinner decision making process, a little bit easier too.</p>
